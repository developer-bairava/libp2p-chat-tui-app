When the first host is ready, it initializes itself on the network and waits for connections. Through the peer discovery mechanism, the host learns about other available peers and builds a list of them. From this list, one peer is selected to start communication, and a message request is sent. The chosen peer receives the request, accepts it, and establishes a secure stream connection. Once the connection is established, both peers can freely exchange messages, and the conversation begins directly between them without any central server.
